# Gomoku
The project displays the Gomoku game with basic GUI. 
This project allows two different users to play in the same Gomoku game. As long as their own computer can connect to the server when they run the project, they can join the same Gomoku game by using different computers. 
It supports running multiple games simultaneously. 
The rule of this game can be found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku
